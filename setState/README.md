# set_state

as the simplest state management approach yet powerful one, `setState` simply works as a refresher of a `StatefulWidget`.
a simple function like following:
```dart
setState((){
  // the code that updates state
});

```
whenever this method gets called, an anonymous function is called inside it in which all updating code must be located.
